# English Course Platform (Test Project)

This is a **test project** for an online English course platform built with **React**. It is **not intended for production use** and is currently **under development**.

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate the use of various modern frontend technologies and techniques, including:

- **React** (functional components)
- **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- **Redux** for state management
- **SCSS** and CSS Modules for styling
- **Reusable components**
- Basic project structure and routing

> **Note:** This project does **not** use React Context API.  
> It is purely a personal learning and experimental project.

Feel free to explore the code and structure, but keep in mind that this project is not complete and may contain placeholder content or unfinished features.
